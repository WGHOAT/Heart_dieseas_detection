# ü´Ä Heart Disease Detection

A machine learning-based system that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in a patient using clinical data. Built using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn. This project involves data preprocessing, model training using Random Forest, and evaluation with accuracy and feature importance.

## üöÄ Objective

To develop a predictive model capable of classifying patients as having heart disease or being healthy, based on various medical parameters. The goal is to assist early diagnosis using data-driven insights.

## üß† Model Pipeline

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Separated numerical and categorical columns.
   - Applied `StandardScaler` to numerical features.
   - Applied `OneHotEncoder` to categorical features.
   - Used `ColumnTransformer` to combine them cleanly.

2. **Train-Test Split**:
   - 80% training, 20% testing using `train_test_split`.

3. **Model**:
   - Used `RandomForestClassifier` with default parameters.
   - Trained on preprocessed training data.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy: **95.38%**
   - Used `classification_report` and `confusion_matrix`.
   - Plotted confusion matrix and feature importance chart.

This Project is Built with a Intent to Learn Not to Deploy in real world and it needs way more dataset to even scatch the real thing.......
